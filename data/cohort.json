I decided that I was ready for more of a challenge in my life. I was certain of two things: my love for technology, and my enjoyment for creating things. This epiphany lead me to become a student at Nashville Software School.</p><p>Once I fully immersed myself into the environment of a software developer, I quickly noticed the great satisfaction that came along with learning so many new technologies. The quest for knowledge has become extremely fulfilling, and I wish to continue learning more every day.</p>",
