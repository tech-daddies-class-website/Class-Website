I started my career out in the IT support lane, which was okay for starting out but I wanted to do more than troubleshooting workstation.  While working with the state in the Higher Education Commission (THEC) I heard about Nashville Software School through a colleague. After checking the stats for myself I was impressed and decided to attend one of their information sessions. In late 2018 I applied to Nashville Software School and was later accepted for cohort 31. When I started programming I became intrigued with all of the things you could do with code. It was after that I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in software development</p>",
